## Lesson Learned

### Definition

- TypeScript is an open-source object-oriented language developed and maintained by Microsoft, licensed under Apache 2 license. It is a typed superset of Javascript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

### Type Annotations

- TypeScript is a typed language, where we can specify the type of the variables, function parameters and object properties. We can specify the type using :Type after the name of the variable, parameter or property.

### Interface

- Interface is a structure that defines the contract in your application. It defines the syntax for classes to follow.
- Classes that are derived from an interface must follow the structure provided by their interface.
- The TypeScript compiler does not convert interface to JavaScript (aka duck typing or structural subtyping).
